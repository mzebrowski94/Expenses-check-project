#### Hello! :wave:

###### This repository contains my "Expenses Check" application.
Expenses Check is a software designed to monitor, update and organize expenses, between users (for example, students sharing an apartment, employees sharing their resources). 

** Technologies: **
- Java 1.8
- Hibernate (JPQL, H2 datebase, MySQL datebase)
- JFC (Swing)
- Maven

** Use instruction: **
The program user connects to the local server via the application, and then after logging in to his own account he has the ability to edit his / her expense history.
If there is no connection to the server, the application connects to the internal database. After a successful online connection, the data is merged and refreshed.

** Preview: **
