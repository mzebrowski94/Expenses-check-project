#### Hello! :wave:

[Info: Application is still in progress] :wrench:

###### This repository contains my "Expenses Check" application.
Expenses Check is a software designed to monitor, update and organize expenses, between users (for example, students sharing an apartment, employees sharing their resources). 

**Technologies:**
- Java 1.8
- Hibernate (JPQL, H2 datebase, MySQL datebase)
- JFC (Swing)
- Maven

**Use instruction:**

Program user connects to the local server via application, and then after logging in to his own account he has the ability to edit his expense history.
If there is no connection to the server, the application connects to the internal embeded database. After a successful online connection, the data between embeded and external datebase is merged and refreshed.

**Preview: [Work in progress..]**
